## Overview

The Task Management App provides users with a platform to create tasks and manage them efficiently. Users can sign in to access the task creation feature, view their tasks, and perform necessary actions like updating or deleting tasks.

## Features

- **User Authentication:** Users can sign up and log in securely using AWS Cognito.
- **Task Creation:** Authenticated users can create new tasks with a task ID, name, and description.
- **Task Viewing:** Users can view tasks they've created.
- **Task Deletion and Editing:** Authenticated users can delete or edit their tasks.

## Tech Stack

### Frontend

- React: Frontend framework for building the user interface.
- React Router: For managing navigation within the app.
- Axios: HTTP client for making API requests.

### Backend

- Python: Backend language.
- Flask: Lightweight web framework for the backend.
- DynamoDB: NoSQL database for storing tasks.
- AWS Amplify: AWS services for authentication and hosting.

## Setup

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install dependencies:

- **Task Display:** Fetched and displayed tasks associated with the authenticated user.

## AWS Services Used

- **Cognito:** For user authentication.
- **DynamoDB:** Database for storing tasks.
- **Amplify:** Authentication and hosting services.

## Authentication and Authorization

### Authentication

Users can sign up, log in, and log out securely using AWS Cognito.
